Overview
============
This is the Generative Adversarial Network Demo written in Python using the Theano ML library. 

Dependencies
============

* Python 2.7+ - (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* matplotlib - `pip install matplotlib`
* theano - `pip install theano`
* scipy - `pip install scipy`
* foxhound (included)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Basic Usage
===========
If your dependencies are installed you can just run the code! A pyplot GUI should pop up and it will get better and better as it trains. 

```shell
python demo.py
```

*Pull Requests are encouraged!!! This pyplot stuff can get wonky, so definitely make a PR if you see something that needs fixing.*

Credits
===========
Credit for this demo code Alec Radford and can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Newmu/4ee0a712454480df5ee3). I've merely moved some functions around and added a lot more documentation.
